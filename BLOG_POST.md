# URL shortener to voice for Clubhouse - [shorten.club](https://shorten.club)

Yes, yes, yes, and yes, I know it doesn't convert links into the voice.

***[shorten.club](https://shorten.club)*** converts link or note buckets into a readable 6-digit number, but why?


## Background - What is Clubhouse?

> In short: Clubhouse is an audio-based social media app. The company describes itself as "a new type of social product based on a voice that allows people everywhere to talk, tell stories, develop ideas, deepen friendships, and meet interesting new people around the world."
> Basically, you can jump in and out of different chats, on different subjects, in something akin to a live, free-flowing podcast. You can simply listen or choose to throw in your thoughts. Imagine a cocktail party or, clubhouse.

## What can't we do in Clubhouse?

Now, you all know what you can do with Clubhouse, now we can focus on what can't you do in Clubhouse. Clubhouse is a great platform to discuss ideas, contact your friends, organize brainstorming sessions or ask questions to known-people, yet it is very limited on other things such as resource sharing such as links, notes, buckets of ideas, movies, songs, etc.

## Why can't I use other URL shorteners?

In the desktop or mobile URL shorteners works pretty well, but when it comes to sharing the shortened URL by voice/by spelling it, it can easily become a nightmare. Since Clubhouse is an international platform, there are people from everywhere which means different languages and accents, etc. Even if people are talking the same language it is hard to spell a shortened URL one by one.

## How did you solve it?

As you know every bank on the planet sends 6-8 digit numbers as SMS when it needs our authentication or 2FA works the same way, or quiz platform Kahoot.it gives 8-digit numbers to join a session. These all inspired us to make a URL shortener that converts buckets/lists into 6-digit numbers. In that way, we can easily memorize the PIN and access the resources with it.

Currently, you can create buckets of links or notes. You can add, update, and delete those resources even after you share them with your audience.

- A bucket of movies to watch: ...
